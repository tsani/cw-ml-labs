# Computing Workshop ML labs

This repo houses the labs that we do in CW ML.

1. k-nearest neighbours color classification
    Training data adapted from [here](https://github.com/rkc007/KNN_color_recognition) with the
    script `extract_colors.py` which produces CSV output of a color name together with and RGB
    triple for that color.
